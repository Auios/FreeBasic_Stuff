9:53 PM - Dau: Jatte
9:53 PM - Dau: Had a networking question
9:54 PM - Jattenalle: turn it off and on again
9:54 PM - Dau: hehe
9:54 PM - Dau: I wanted to know about how you do efficient things
9:54 PM - Dau: the way you do things
9:55 PM - Dau: If i had my player or w/e
9:55 PM - Dau: the server needs to give other clients data about my client
9:55 PM - Dau: such as position
9:55 PM - Dau: would you send a header byte with your data to the client?
9:55 PM - Dau: well i was thinking like
9:56 PM - Dau: Header - Length- (x - y)
9:56 PM - Jattenalle: dont do that
9:56 PM - Dau: but I had a different idea
9:56 PM - Jattenalle: the number one, huge mistake, people make with network code
9:56 PM - Dau: Head - x - y - end
9:56 PM - Jattenalle: is they send each thing as its own packet
9:56 PM - Jattenalle: it's a HORRIBLE idea
9:56 PM - Dau: :o
9:57 PM - Jattenalle: a TCP packet for example, has a LOT of header data
9:57 PM - Jattenalle: let's for the sake of argument, say your TCP packet has 50 bytes of header
9:57 PM - Jattenalle: that is the TCP protocol header, not your code
9:57 PM - Dau: jesus
9:57 PM - Jattenalle: and you send 10 bytes
9:57 PM - Jattenalle: that'sa  60 byte packet
9:57 PM - Jattenalle: 50 of which is just "waste" (for your purposes)
9:57 PM - Jattenalle: so what you do is you send packets at a set interval
9:57 PM - Jattenalle: for a shooter, say 100 times per second
9:58 PM - Jattenalle: for an RTS, say 10 times per second, and so on
9:58 PM - Jattenalle: so instead of having:
9:58 PM - Jattenalle: packet 1 = header, x, y, end (as you suggest)
9:58 PM - Jattenalle: packet 2 = other header, some other data, end
9:58 PM - Jattenalle: and so on
9:58 PM - Jattenalle: you'd have:
9:58 PM - Jattenalle: packet 1 = header, x, y, end, other header, some other data, end
9:58 PM - Jattenalle: you want to pack as much data as possible into each packet
9:59 PM - Jattenalle: a good way to set it up (in my opinion) is to have a cache you write your network data to
9:59 PM - Dau: i see
9:59 PM - Jattenalle: and once every X milliseconds, if the cache contains data, you send it, then clear it
9:59 PM - Jattenalle: so instead of doing: Send(mydata); all the time
9:59 PM - Jattenalle: you basically do: addNetworkData(mydata);
9:59 PM - Dau: Thats actually what I did on one of my first servers. Except i was using strings and converting the strings to numbers like a noob
9:59 PM - Dau: :P
10:00 PM - Jattenalle: and every 16 milliseconds or so, you do: Send(allmydata); clearNetworkData();
10:00 PM - Dau: oh ya ya
10:00 PM - Dau: ok ok
10:00 PM - Dau: :D
10:00 PM - Jattenalle: but in regards to your question
10:00 PM - Jattenalle: if you pack your x,y in binary
10:00 PM - Jattenalle: for example, x and y are both integers
10:00 PM - Jattenalle: then they'll take 4 bytes each
10:00 PM - Jattenalle: you know this, it is a fact
10:01 PM - Jattenalle: so for your "position" packet (identified via its header) you know there will be 8 bytes to read
10:01 PM - Jattenalle: no need for an "end" marker, or a length marker
10:01 PM - Dau: well
10:01 PM - Jattenalle: for "text" (say, chat, player names, whatever) you should probably use a length marker
10:01 PM - Dau: yes need if theres dynamic
10:01 PM - Jattenalle: ie: header, length, name-data
10:01 PM - Dau: ah ya
10:01 PM - Dau: i made this simple server client thing right now
10:01 PM - Dau: and it has a map
10:01 PM - Dau: of 50x20
10:02 PM - Dau: it sends 9x9 tiles of data that is around the client
10:02 PM - Dau: to the client
10:02 PM - Dau: but if its next to the edge of the map
10:02 PM - Dau: no need to send tiles that dont exist
10:02 PM - Dau: so the client doesnt always get 9x9 tiles
10:02 PM - Dau: thats when I started using end byte
10:02 PM - Jattenalle: the problem with an end byte
10:02 PM - Jattenalle: is taht you are effectively restricting yourself
10:02 PM - Dau: but i do like yours however I dont know how id do it
10:03 PM - Dau: also how
10:03 PM - Dau: ?
10:03 PM - Jattenalle: the way i'd do it (and do, in GaI, for planet resource stockpiles for example)
10:03 PM - Jattenalle: is: header, numtiles, [tiledata]
10:03 PM - Jattenalle: where tiledata is repeated numtiles, times
10:03 PM - Jattenalle: which can be 0
10:04 PM - Jattenalle: that way you can send more data for each tile
10:04 PM - Jattenalle: if you ever need to
10:04 PM - Jattenalle: for example, right now you might only have tile type
10:04 PM - Jattenalle: so: header, numtiles, [tiledata] becomes, say: 10, 1, 50
10:04 PM - Jattenalle: the tile-data packet header is 10 (because i say so!), you're sending 1 tile, and the tile data only holds 50
10:05 PM - Jattenalle: but say your tiles can have, i dunno, an elevation value (how high above sealevel they are)
10:05 PM - Jattenalle: the same thing becomes: 10, 1, 50, 20
10:05 PM - Jattenalle: 10 header, 1 tile, type 50, elevation 20
10:05 PM - Jattenalle: if you were sending 2 tiles:
10:05 PM - Jattenalle: 10, 2, 50, 20, 79, 20
10:06 PM - Jattenalle: 10 header (we just made that up), 2 tiles, first tile is of type 50 at elevation 20, second tile is of type 79 at elevation 20
10:06 PM - Jattenalle: yeah
10:06 PM - Jattenalle: this way, you know when you begin reading the data, EXACTLY how much you need to read
10:06 PM - Jattenalle: as opposed to reading it all, until you hit the end
10:06 PM - Dau: header - fornext(tile,x,y)
10:06 PM - Dau: if tile = endbyte then dont grab x,y
10:07 PM - Dau: and stop waiting for data
10:07 PM - Jattenalle: yeah which is messy code
10:07 PM - Jattenalle: header, read numtiles, for(numtiles, read the data)
10:07 PM - Dau: ok this is good
10:07 PM - Dau: i guess I have some rewriting to do
10:07 PM - Dau: but next question
10:07 PM - Dau: i send my x,y as two shorts
10:08 PM - Dau: and tile ID as a ubyte
10:08 PM - Dau: and you said you have this
10:08 PM - Dau: addDataBuffer(data); thing
10:08 PM - Jattenalle: i have a helper thing set up to handle it
10:08 PM - Dau: how can I add data to the buffer and the computer know what data is a byte and whats not a byte
10:08 PM - Jattenalle: needs some code, obviously
10:09 PM - Jattenalle: but basically, i have a buffer that is set to MAX_NETWORKPACKETSIZE
10:09 PM - Jattenalle: (which differs)
10:09 PM - Jattenalle: it's basically just an allocated piece of memory
10:09 PM - Jattenalle: i have another variable taht is basically: cacheWritePosition
10:09 PM - Jattenalle: and i have a few functions, but let's say i have: addData(data)
10:10 PM - Jattenalle: addData(data) { myCache[cacheWritePosition] = data; cacheWritePosition++; }
10:10 PM - Jattenalle: and then of course: sendData();
10:11 PM - Jattenalle: sendData(){ NET.Send(myCache, cacheWritePosition); mem_fill(myCache, cacheWritePosition, 0); cacheWritePosition = 0; }
10:11 PM - Jattenalle: give or take, pseudocode
10:11 PM - Jattenalle: note that "cacheWritePosition" gives you the amount of data in the cache, for free basically
10:11 PM - Dau: ok
10:12 PM - Dau: its the size of the data you're sending
10:12 PM - Dau: ?
10:12 PM - Jattenalle: well it's obviously the size, since it goes up every time you add data
10:12 PM - Dau: right right
10:13 PM - Jattenalle: if you add 1 bute, the cacheWritePosition goes up by 1 :P
10:13 PM - Jattenalle: so 1 byte written, and position is now 1, so.. it works out very well
10:13 PM - Dau: yes
10:13 PM - Dau: :)
10:13 PM - Dau: but something my novice education doesnt comprehend yet
10:14 PM - Dau: &hFF &hAA23 &hD3
10:14 PM - Dau: thats 4 bytes right there
10:14 PM - Dau: when I add FF to the buffer
10:14 PM - Dau: and then AA23
10:14 PM - Dau: wont it look like
10:14 PM - Dau: FFAA23
10:14 PM - Dau: in the buffer?
10:14 PM - Dau: er
10:14 PM - Dau: Cache
10:14 PM - Dau: how does the computer know that FF is its own data
10:14 PM - Jattenalle: when you read it
10:14 PM - Dau: and AA23 are together
10:14 PM - Jattenalle: if you read a byte
10:15 PM - Jattenalle: it will read a byte
10:15 PM - Jattenalle: which in your example would be &HFF
10:15 PM - Jattenalle: it doesnt care what coems after
10:15 PM - Jattenalle: if you tell it to read a short (2 bytes), it will read: FFAA
10:15 PM - Jattenalle: and if you tell it to read an integer (4 bytes) your program will crash
10:15 PM - Jattenalle: because there are only three bytes to read
10:15 PM - Jattenalle: :D
10:16 PM - Dau: im just worried that
10:16 PM - Dau: data might get
10:16 PM - Dau: askewed
10:16 PM - Dau: and itll throw the entire buffer off by a byte or something
10:16 PM - Jattenalle: then you fucked up
10:16 PM - Dau: ya
10:16 PM - Dau: so
10:16 PM - Dau: when should I use UDP
10:17 PM - Jattenalle: whwnever only the LAST packet matters
10:17 PM - Jattenalle: and you dont care about anything that came before
10:17 PM - Dau: well all data is important
10:17 PM - Jattenalle: also if you use UDP, remember to add a value int he header that just goes up by 1 every time you send a packet
10:17 PM - Jattenalle: because UDP can arrive in any order
10:17 PM - Jattenalle: not in the order they were sent
10:17 PM - Dau: so
10:18 PM - Jattenalle: so you have a way to know if a pcket is "older "than one you already recieved
10:18 PM - Jattenalle: and just ignore it
10:18 PM - Dau: when using UDP add an extra byte to tell the order?
10:18 PM - Jattenalle: yeah, one or two bytes
10:18 PM - Jattenalle: depending on how often you send packets
10:18 PM - Jattenalle: one byte isnt enough if you send several packets per second
10:18 PM - Dau: well if its recv
10:18 PM - Dau: recv'd in any order
10:18 PM - Dau: what if my header byte
10:18 PM - Dau: is after the actual data
10:18 PM - Dau: because UDP
10:19 PM - Jattenalle: ok
10:19 PM - Jattenalle: well UDP and TCP work the same in regards to datagrams
10:19 PM - Jattenalle: all your data will arrive at the same time if it's part of the same packet
10:19 PM - Jattenalle: so each packet will arrive "complete"
10:19 PM - Jattenalle: but say you have on your server:
10:19 PM - Jattenalle: send packet 1
10:19 PM - Jattenalle: send packet 2
10:19 PM - Jattenalle: send packet 3
10:20 PM - Jattenalle: with TCP, the client will always recieve: 1, 2, 3
10:20 PM - Jattenalle: with UDP, they might arrive: 2, 1, 3.. or 1, 3, 2.. or 1, 2, 3
10:20 PM - Jattenalle: so what you do is, on your server:
10:20 PM - Jattenalle: send packet 1 with UDP header 1st packet
10:20 PM - Jattenalle: send packet 2 with UDP header 2nd packet
10:20 PM - Jattenalle: send packet 3 with UDP header 3rd packet
10:21 PM - Jattenalle: so when you read it with UDP, you read the first packet you recieve
10:21 PM - Jattenalle: and that first packet you read, says: header 2nd packet
10:21 PM - Jattenalle: you store that integer, that 2
10:21 PM - Jattenalle: and read the next packet: header 1st packet
10:21 PM - Jattenalle: oh, ok, 1 is less than 2, which measn this is an "older" packet, fuck it! ignore!
10:21 PM - Jattenalle: read the next packet, it's header 3rd packet (duh)
10:22 PM - Jattenalle: 3 is more than 2, it's a newer packet! handle it!
10:22 PM - Jattenalle: and increase the integer to 3
10:22 PM - Dau: !
10:22 PM - Jattenalle: at some point you will need to reset that counter btw
10:22 PM - Jattenalle: i suggest a special packet just for that
10:22 PM - Jattenalle: so server sends: reset UDP counter
10:22 PM - Jattenalle: and client.. well does just that :P
10:22 PM - Dau: Amazing :D
10:22 PM - Jattenalle: mind you! if you set that up wrong, you can end up with some issues
10:23 PM - Jattenalle: ie: reset UDP counter -> arrives at client, client resets -> an OLD udp packet arrives very late, has a UDP counter of 50'000!
10:23 PM - Dau: the server would have to keep track of all the client's UDP counters then eh
10:23 PM - Jattenalle: client goes: oh hey! 50k is more than 0! guess 50k is the new counter!
10:23 PM - Dau: haha
10:23 PM - Jattenalle: so you should also discard any packet that is WAY higher than current
10:23 PM - Dau: and they wouldnt get the newer data
10:23 PM - Jattenalle: exactly :P
10:23 PM - Dau: because newdata < 50,000
10:23 PM - Jattenalle: indeed
10:24 PM - Dau: because UDP previous packets
10:24 PM - Dau: still can arrive out of order
10:24 PM - Dau: ok
10:24 PM - Dau: ya simple conditional statements then can fix that
10:24 PM - Jattenalle: so what i do is check if the clientCounter is less than X difference
10:24 PM - Jattenalle: yeah it's pretty simple
10:24 PM - Dau: if the new packet difference is more than n
10:24 PM - Dau: ah
10:24 PM - Dau: beat me to it
10:24 PM - Dau: :)
10:25 PM - Jattenalle: clientCounter needs to be LESS than the packet counter, AND packet counter needs to be less than X larger than the client counter
10:25 PM - Jattenalle: messy english, but you get it
10:25 PM - Dau: yea
10:25 PM - Jattenalle: and as for keeping track of each clients counter
10:25 PM - Jattenalle: nope, that's the beauty
10:25 PM - Jattenalle: you can just use a single one for all clients
10:25 PM - Dau: o
10:25 PM - Jattenalle: just remember to code for that
10:25 PM - Dau: OH
10:25 PM - Dau: ya
10:25 PM - Dau: thats right
10:26 PM - Jattenalle: also, if one client might recieve a LOT of packets that arent sent to all other clients... yeah you want to separate that
10:25 PM - Dau: ok!
10:26 PM - Jattenalle: but if it's data that all clients get.. yeah just use one counter
10:26 PM - Dau: ok
10:26 PM - Jattenalle: anyhow, TCP is a lot easier, since it always arrives in order
10:26 PM - Dau: well my game has a lot of private data for each individual client
10:26 PM - Dau: and for now ill use TCP
10:26 PM - Jattenalle: yeah, another thing with UDP is you dont know if it arrived or not
10:26 PM - Dau: ya mysoft told me that
10:27 PM - Jattenalle: in fact, with UDP, you dont even know if there's a connection at all
10:27 PM - Dau: didnt know that one
10:27 PM - Jattenalle: you can just send UDP packets to anything
10:27 PM - Jattenalle: you will get no reply
10:27 PM - Jattenalle: UDP is "connectionless"
10:27 PM - Jattenalle: for example, you could literally send UDP to 0.0.0.0 or 255.255.255.1
10:27 PM - Jattenalle: and you would get no indication that anything is wrong
10:27 PM - Jattenalle: .... or right :PÖ
10:27 PM - Dau: :o
10:28 PM - Jattenalle: but with TCP, if you tried to connec to 0.0.0.0 it would tell you to stop being dumb :3
10:28 PM - Dau: hehe
10:28 PM - Dau: Thanks Jatte
10:29 PM - Dau: I guess I have some things to code now
10:29 PM - Jattenalle: write a binary helper first
10:29 PM - Jattenalle: it's always nice to have
10:29 PM - Dau: why do i need that?
10:29 PM - Jattenalle: ie: writeByte(data); that writes a single byte to your cache memory
10:29 PM - Jattenalle: and: readByte(memory) that reads a single byte from memory
10:29 PM - Dau: yes ah
10:29 PM - Dau: ok
10:29 PM - Dau: binary helper though?
10:30 PM - Jattenalle: you'll figure it out ;)
10:30 PM - Jattenalle: well that's what i call it
10:30 PM - Dau: whys that
10:30 PM - Jattenalle: read and write data, and it's in binary as opposed to strings?
10:30 PM - Dau: sounds like a...
10:30 PM - Dau: Cache helper to me
10:30 PM - Dau: well
10:30 PM - Jattenalle: YEH WELL! MY NAME IS BETTER!
10:30 PM - Dau: everything is in binary :o
10:30 PM - Jattenalle: AND YOU'RE WRONG!
10:30 PM - Jattenalle: *cries*
10:30 PM - Jattenalle: actually, let me check what i named mine
10:30 PM - Dau: im naming my helper cachehelper.bas just to spite you
10:30 PM - Jattenalle: i think i named it PacketHelper
10:30 PM - Dau: ok i can deal with that :)
10:31 PM - Jattenalle: ah
10:31 PM - Dau: oh you didnt answer my question
10:31 PM - Jattenalle: PacketHandler
10:31 PM - Jattenalle: function PH_ReadInteger(byval i as PH_Packet ptr) as integer
if i->readPtr + 4 > i->maxSize then i->error = PH_ERROR_OVERFLOW: return 0
dim as integer ret = cast(integer ptr, i->data+i->readPtr)[0]
i->readPtr+=4
return ret
end function
10:31 PM - Dau: that looks like
10:31 PM - Dau: FB
10:31 PM - Jattenalle: of course it is
10:31 PM - Dau: which answers my question
10:31 PM - Dau: :)
10:31 PM - Jattenalle: sub PH_AddInteger(byval p as PH_Packet ptr, byval s as integer)
if p->size + 4 > p->maxSize then PH_PacketGrow(p, 128)
cast(integer ptr, p->data + p->size)[0] = s
p->size+=4
end sub
10:32 PM - Jattenalle: i could just send you this file if you want
10:31 PM - Dau: omg yes
10:34 PM - Jattenalle: gonna have to add you to the copy notice
10:34 PM - Jattenalle: man! all this work!
10:34 PM - Jattenalle: look what you made me do!
10:35 PM - Dau: copy notice? :o
10:35 PM - Dau: Whats a copy notice? x.x
10:36 PM - Jattenalle: (REMOVED LINK)
10:36 PM - Jattenalle: paste expires in an hour
10:36 PM - Jattenalle: be sure to save it
10:36 PM - Jattenalle: copy notice is the thing at the top
10:37 PM - Jattenalle: usage:
10:37 PM - Jattenalle: dim myVariable as PH_Packet
10:37 PM - Jattenalle: myVariable = PH_CreatePacket()
10:37 PM - Jattenalle: PH_AddByte(@myVariable, 50)
10:38 PM - Jattenalle: PH_Reset(@myVariable)
10:38 PM - Jattenalle: print PH_ReadByte(@myVariable)
10:38 PM - Dau: saved thanks
10:38 PM - Jattenalle: that should get you started
10:38 PM - Jattenalle: that should get you started
10:39 PM - Jattenalle: just remember to PH_DeletePacket(@myPacket) when you want to remove it
10:39 PM - Dau: Right
10:39 PM - Jattenalle: or PH_ResetPacket(@myPacket) if you want to keep the packet variable, but remove all data
